/**
 * Workers AI compatibility shim — the real fix for P0-0a's second crash
 * (`AI_InvalidResponseDataError: Expected 'id' to be a string.`).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * docs/INVESTIGATION_2026-07-28.md concluded the crash was probably specific
 * to the GitHub Actions sandbox, because the identical prompt/model/config ran
 * clean outside Docker. That conclusion was wrong, and this file replaces it.
 * What actually happens:
 *
 *   - The error string belongs to the Vercel AI SDK, not to OpenCode and not
 *     to the sandbox. `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` (docker/opencode.json's npm
 *     provider) validates every `tool_calls[].id` against the OpenAI spec,
 *     which requires a string, and throws `AI_InvalidResponseDataError` when
 *     it isn't one. Reported upstream against other providers whose models
 *     emit integer ids.
 *   - Cloudflare's 2026-02-17 changelog: "/v1/chat/completions now preserves
 *     original tool call IDs from models instead of regenerating them."
 *     Before that, every id was a Cloudflare-generated string and this class
 *     of bug was impossible; after it, whatever `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`
 *     emits reaches the client untouched.
 *
 * That combination explains the evidence the "sandbox" theory never could:
 * the crash landing on the ~5th tool call after four clean round trips, and a
 * single un-sandboxed local run passing. It is a per-tool-call property of the
 * model's output, so it is nondeterministic — one clean local run was one
 * lucky sample, not a control proving the sandbox guilty.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Runs on the Actions runner (not inside the sandbox) between OpenCode and
 * Cloudflare, and normalizes both directions:
 *
 *   response  tool_calls[].id -> String(id)   the actual crash
 *   request   assistant content null -> ""    a second real incompatibility
 *                                             the same investigation hit
 *                                             directly against the API
 *
 * Both are lossless for well-formed traffic: a string id is already a string,
 * and only assistant messages that carry tool_calls are touched.
 *
 * ## Why it also holds the credential
 *
 * Because the shim injects `Authorization` itself, CF_API_TOKEN no longer has
 * to be handed to the container at all. The sandbox's whole egress-filtering
 * design (Squid + DOCKER-USER) exists to stop an --auto agent exfiltrating
 * that token; not putting it in the container is strictly better than
 * containing it.
 *
 * Exports its transforms so they can be tested without a network or an API
 * key — see scripts/test_workers_ai_shim.js.

 * String(null) would invent the id "null" and silently break the tool-result
 * correlation that ids exist for, turning a loud crash into a wrong answer.
